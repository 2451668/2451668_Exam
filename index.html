                <p>My name is Thabang Maleka, and I'm a 20-year-old, third year student at the University of the Witwatersrand. I'm currently enrolled in the WSOA Digital Art and Game Design programme, and have Interactive Media, Animation, and Digital Art Theory as my primary subjects. </p>

Most of the website is loosely themed around abstract art and graphics.

I hope to have made, or at least have begun creating, a sort of portfolio I can work on this year and next, in addition to having completed the degree.</li>
