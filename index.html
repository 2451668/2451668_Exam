                <p>This is the profile and portfolio portion of the site. I'll talk a little about myself here.</p>
                <p>My name is Thabang Maleka, and I'm a 20-year-old student at the University of the Witwatersrand. I'm currently enrolled in the WSOA Digital Art and Game Design programme, and have Interactive Media, Animation, and Digital Art Theory as my primary subjects. </p>

                        <li><span>Art</span><br>Visual art is something I've been fond of for most of my childhood, doing tradtional graphite and ink for most of my early life, before recently exploring digital art. Most of the website is loosly themed around abstract art and graphics. All photos, art, and code used in the creation of the site are appropriately credited and referenced in the design section </li>
                        <li><span>Animation</span><br>Another interest I've picked up during my time at Wits, is 2D animating and illustrating on digital software.</li>
