                    <h2>Week one</h2>
                    <p>The week was the starting week and first introductory class in Interactive media. The course primarily has to do with front-end web development, which is to say, to process of designing and building sites intended to run on a browser.
                        I had taken a look at the CBO, and it detailed some of what we would be going over and what we will eventually be assessed on during this semester as well as what we can expect for the final year submission.
                        The bulk of the technical component being familiarising ourselves with the basic languages associated with web dev, namely HTML, CSS, and of course JavaScript. It helps that we had already done game design prior to this module, so general practices in coding as well as the concept of a good workflow/school of thought in creating and reiterating is not so foreign.
                        The only practical work was setting up our GitHub Repositories with Andre.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Week two</h2>
                    <p>This week was further building on the previous week's introductory material, however included this week was some dedicated time going through the HTML and the basics. I had partially done some HTML in high school, so it is not completely brand new, though much of it feels that way since it was so long ago.
                        The associated readings for the week delt with quite a few topics, concerning good form and user practices when design and creating websites, or rather the code for them. The segment on accessibility via screen readers was something new that I had never gave thought to previously, but interesting in how the software in browsers interacts with code rather than just being a platform to showcase it.
                        The history of what is considered the internet is interesting in that unlike a few other technological developments, it was developed and promoted at a rather rapid pace, and after just 2 decades became an integral part of human society, not simply a tool to help out certain task.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Week three</h2>
                    <p>This week was more fun than the last two and featured some good practical content as well. The introduction to CSS, unlike HTML, was something I had no prior experience in, so seeing the ways it in addition to HMTL are both used to structure and frame websites was new and exciting.
                        CSS seems particularly robust and looking at a few sites online that all feature it in their development, or adaptations of it, was exciting and gave me a bit more insight into using the tool to make sites that are visually appealing in addition to functionally sound and appropriate.
                        The relationship between what the user sees, and what they experience, and how they reinforce each other seems like one thing that, although can be reliably explained theoretically, has a large portion of intuition and feeling in order to really be able and grasp, and more important evoke within the products that they produce. It is something that I suspect, unlike code which remains static, is always changing with every project and the needs it has to fulfil.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="blog-items">
                <div>
                    <h2>Week four</h2>
                    <p>This week was fairly intensive, as it was our first serious encounter with JavaScript, which I now understand to be the brains of site, if HMTL and CSS are the body and outward appearance.
                        It is a lightweight programming language that functionally controls everything interactable in the site, both known and unknown to the user.
                        We were given a handful of exercises to do that our lecturer Andre released the memos for, and many of my solutions were incorrect or incomplete. It is still good practice seeing the things I went wrong in, and the ones I had sort of correct, how they could have been written and structured better.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Week seven</h2>
                    <p>This week was relatively light, as it mainly had to with the ethics behind the work we are doing and would-be as future developers. It was interesting going through the material as it dealt with topic primarily to do with intent behind the decisions that teams take when implementing UI and in turn the desired response from the consumer
                        The most interesting insight was the segment on Dark UX. The idea behind using patterns and implementing that more so serve to benefit the companies behind the software rather than the customer using said software. It was most interesting observing Dark UX is not the result of poor or accidental UX design, but rather something much more directional and intentional./p>

                        <p> This was the orginal wireframe for out first assignment. It was relatively simple in hindsite, although helped in establishing concepts I'd later make use of in the final, revised site.</p>

                        <p>The goal for the website wasto showcases a bit about myself as well as illustrate some of the techincal skills covered during the semester. The primary audience would the marker, and as such most of the content has to do with fulfilling the requirements set in the rubric. I aimed to create a visually appealing and creative experience by use of interesting colours and abstract patterns, juxatoposed against simple white backgrounds in some sections, as well as a generally adherence to standard visual desigin principles. </p>
                        <p>Most of the information has to do with adaqately conforming to what the brief expects from the site, and as sucg, I have layerd all five section on their own pages, in a way that they take up the entirety of each page, thus making it as easy as possible for the marker to get the complete scope of everything to be seen. The large gaps in between elements makes it easy to visually navigate from information to infromation, as each element takes up a discint space on the screen and does not compete with another leading to better visual clarity overall; this is accordance to the Fitts' Law,</p>

                        <p>Due to the nature of site, flow from page to page is considerably easy and intuitive, as all one needs to do is scroll from the current point to the desired, though the option to simply use the navigation bar as an interaction point for traverseing the site, is another option available to users.</p>
                        <p> The first screen of course features the header and navbar, the latter having some slight animation when users hover over it; the underline acts as a point of interest, and serves to indidcate familirity to the users, the way hyperlinks are typically formatted. This is consistent across all instances of the site featuring links</p>
                        <P>A few of the other graphics in the other pages also feature slight animations or effects when the user interacts with them. This was done with the intent to mark relavent points of interest to the user across all portions of the sites.

                <section class="row">
                    <section class="design-column-two">
                        <p>As mentioned earlier in the site, the main reference for this final submission was actually the submission before this, which you can find <a href="https://2451668.github.io/2451668_Assignment_3/index.html">here</a></p>
                        <p>The visual design language of the site changed dramatically from that previous attempt, most notably the amount of graphics, effects, and of course content. </p>
                        <P>From this site, I mainted the same font Poppins sans-serif, one of four typefaces by Jonny Pinhorn. It ranks well in terms of both readability and legibility, though for more clarity and visual appeal I purposfully chose bolder or more weighted values for much of the text of the site. Given that the design of characters is fairly unifrom, increasing the weight would not lead to any strange overallping or visual incongrunces.</P>
                        <p>This site features much more colour than the previous attempts, enhancing the user experience by creating more visual interest. The flurry of colours are balanced by segments in pages that are completey monotone, epscially in regard to text, as not in impact how the user would consume information.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="design-column-one">
                        <p>Most of the site features large blocky containers that stand out from any background elements, some even featuring light animation effects. This makes it easier to layer content ontop of, with large spacing meaning that content would not compete with each other for the users attention.</p>
                        <p>While being square shaped still, I opted to feature significantly rounded corners, to complemet the general typeface of the website.</p>
                        <p>
                        The contrast of abstract backgrounds and plain containers I feel creates a good context onto which text and other information can be layered on top off, with some of the more important text and headers sharing colour codes with the supporting background elements and leading to a coherent visual sctructure overall

                        <p>The goal was to create a pleasent looking website showcasing my liking for abstraction and art in a flat, simple approach.</p>
                        <p>As such, many portions of the site feature various pieces of abstract art that also servered as the guide for what sorts of colours would influnce the formatting of the text </p>
                        <p>This lead to some pretty interesting decisions as far as the user of colour goes. I also felt it important to have each page be different from the one preceeding it, as to avoid monotony and maintain visual interest at various parts of the site.</p>

                <h1>This is the essay I wrote regarding the structure of UI UX of a particular website, where I presented a detailed analysis of the UI and UX, and the ethics of the design.</h1>
                <p>“Design is the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order.”</p>
                <p>This phrase was taken from one of our assigned readings for this course, Design for the Real World, by the late designer and educator Victor Papanek, and is a phrase I like to keep in mind whenever reading or writing about what designing something is and how to do it. (Papanek, 2006)</p>
                <p>As for this assignment, the brief had us select and analyse an SA-made website, examine how it holds up when using and examining its UI/UX, and comment on the ethical aspects of its design practises. It was important to me to select a website that provided products and services that were accessible to and used by many people. For this reason, I chose the website for the telecommunications company Telkom (www.telkom.co.za) and will talk about my experience navigating the site.</p>
                <p>Established in Johannesburg in 1991, Telkom has been a wired and wireless network operator and service provider for over thirty years, a company many individuals and businesses rely on for providing and facilitating telecommunication. When hearing the name Telkom, what comes to the minds of many is an internet service provider, though they offer a variety of products and IT-related services.</p>
                <p>The essay will be structured into three primary segments, with the first detailing the overall interface and visual design and coherency. The second will go into experience and navigation/usage. Lastly, a brief portion discusses the ethics and more intangible aspects of the overall interaction between the object and the user. The analysis will primarily be facilitated via two of the course readings: the aforementioned book by Papanek as well as the blogpost, 14 Principles of Design," by the Polish design studio UXpin.</p>
                <p>When landing on their website, the user is met with a very blue homepage. It is almost entirely the same shade of blue (specifically #0081c2) and is the hue featured almost exclusively on all their branding, apart from plain white. It is a modern site and features a simple, non-sticky header with the navigation bar and its menu beneath it. The homepage is entirely ad space, featuring an interactable slider that a user could click through to review each product offering. There are no sidebars, and so as the user scrolls down the body of the page, a handful of sections feature more texts and graphics in relation to mobile products and internet offerings for the user to look through. The page ends with a large footer in a much darker blue that features many links with various functionality spilt into five columns. When using the nav bar, it expectably prompts drop-down menus that link to the various relevant webpages, all of which are stylistically similar, primarily sporting their signature blue and white look, large gadgetrelated images, and their custom sans-serif typeface throughout all their text.</p>
                <p>Telkom's design language for their website is visually coherent, aesthetically simple, but effective. The colour palette is limited to just white and blue, with supplementary colouring in the accents and media/imagery. Their typeface is consistent and always a dark colour against a light backdrop, with the spacing of relevant headings making them accessible and easy to read. Looking at how all of this functions experientially, there are parts where Telkom does well and parts where it falls short. From the first click of the link, the user is immediately met with large advertisements for mobile devices and internet packages. This is unsurprising, given the nature of Telkom's business and shows an awareness by them of who their userbase is in this instance: individuals looking to browse or shop for device or data plans. This ad section, however, covers the entirety of the homepage and competes with the header and navbar for the user's visual attention. This has largely to do with all three of these contiguous elements being the same shade of blue, unfortunately causing all of them to blend with each other. The navbar features labels with downward arrows, standard for indicating a drop-down menu that features information relevant to the menu title in a simple black-onwhite colour scheme. This layout has a three-step principal and makes it easy to get to what a shopper or customer would be looking for in this context without looping around many hyperlinks and pages. It also helps offset the fact that the homepage is already cluttered with labels all around the edges that are in a small font size and might be jarring to navigate through. Immediate call-to-actions are buttons and labels in an interesting bright magenta colour, in contrast to the rest of the cool-toned website.</p>
                <p>The product layouts are revenant to the user's interests and feature most of the information at a glance about products without the user needing to even interact with the site in some instances. The phones and other gadgets are displayed with clear bold headings and associated imagery and feature the plans they come standard with and the price for that instance of the bundle. These sparse and simple figures let the user making cursory mental comparisons about offerings on the go without needing to tabulate their own values (though an option to rigidly compare plans and offerings exist, too, if that is something a particular user requires).</p>
                <p>The interface and experience remain consistent across both desktop mobile browsers and devices, though the font and graphic scaling are naturally much larger on mobile displays to accommodate the fact that when on a phone, users would not want to incessantly pinch in to view and read microtext. This comes at the cost of the website being trickier to navigate, not in terms of complexity, but because everything requires a lot of swiping and tapping to traverse through different pages, as opposed to a few clicks on a desktop, which shows you everything on said page. This, however, is not necessarily a fault of Telkom but rather the nature of mobile web browsing.</p>
                <p>Considering that this is first and foremost an e-commerce website, Telkom's primary objective is to get you to purchase one of their products and services. There are a few invasive elements when first viewing the site that may annoy the user, such as the requirement to accept some digital cookies, that collect user data under the guise of making the site more personal for the user, something a user may have no need for. There are also occasional popups to subscribe to Telkom's digital mailing and prompts for knowing the user's location and sending notifications.</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that there are typically two camps of users who'd come to this website generally; those simply browsing the range and planning a protentional purchase, and the second group being those with the intention of making a purchase or are very close to it. Telkom's does a good job catering to both without the expense of the other, in that after the initial barrage of advertisements for unrelated products to the user, there are no further ads or popups to distract the user from their primary purpose on any given webpage they have navigated to, showing only information relevant to that page in particular.</p>
                <p>Web developers have the responsibility of creating designs that facilitate the experience and cater to the needs of the user, without distracting the user or pushing them in a direction that does not have to do with their needs that have to be fulfilled. Overall, Telkom and its web staff have made a commendable effort in creating a site that creates an environment that is relevant and one that is easy to navigate, considering a variety of potential users with varying needs, without compromising the common experience of any one group of users.</p>

                <h1>This essay topic this time was addressing the impact of algorithmic culture and AI on the internet using one ethical internet theoretical framework.</h1>
                <p>“Analyses of the internet have often mistaken connection for closeness, and closeness for commitment, but ‘closeness, even intimacy, does not guarantee recognition or responsibility.” (Orgad, 2007:37)</p>
                <p>This quote, one I found particularly profound, is taken from the text 
                    The internet as a moral space: the legacy of Roger Silverstone, a journal 
                    article by Professor Shani Orgad, which itself is in reference to another 
                    text by the late Roger Silverstone. This was one of the readings students 
                    were allowed to select from regarding the topic of an "ethical internet" 
                    and talks about the presence that the internet and media have in human 
                    interaction with regard to morality and responsibility in promoting and 
                    facilitating ethical conduct in cyberspace.</p>
                <p>She writes that the media and the internet are fundamentally inscribed 
                    into human social, cultural, economic, and political processes, as 
                    opposed to merely being an avenue or vehicle for them. This 
                    observation was correct even then; however, the relationship that 
                    people have with media and the internet has developed into something 
                    much deeper than what it was when Orgad wrote this piece sixteen 
                    years ago. Much of life today is digital, with a pronounced dependency on electronic communication in human interaction, either with other 
                    users or the net itself. With this, the advent and ramifications of 
                    artificial intelligence in particular are far more pronounced than were 
                    the case sixteen years ago, or even one year ago for that matter. With 
                    AI’s rapid development and integration into online spaces and activities, 
                    ethical concerns over misuse and misconduct and the malignant aspects 
                    of AI have grown and gained traction. This brings me to the case study 
                    for this writing, the Statement on AI Risk. In combination with the 
                    aforementioned Orgad reading as well as a few additional sources, I will 
                    aim to conduct an analysis of the roles algorithmic culture and AI play 
                    on the internet today.
                    </p>
                <p>The statement in question is a single sentence saying:</p>
                <p>“Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside 
                    other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” (Center for AI 
                    Safety, 2023)</p>
                <p>Brought by the nonprofit Centre for AI Safety (CAIS), this manifesto 
                    was signed by over 350 AI researchers, ethicists, engineers, and 
                    company executives, among other representative individuals, who share 
                    concerns over the serious potential for harm from unregulated 
                    development and misuse of artificial intelligence, likening the sense of 
                    urgency to the recent pandemic and threat of nuclear war (Centre for 
                    AI Safety, 2023). AI’s ability to generate content that is at times 
                    indistinguishable from human-made content, operate autonomous 
                    weaponry, create and spread disinformation, and disrupt other software 
                    systems are what the CAIS considers so detrimental about AI and its 
                    irresponsible advancement (Centre for AI Safety, 2023). The CAIS 
                    briefly touches on many of these malignant aspects, eight of which are 
                    on their website, though for the purposes of this essay I would like to 
                    outline two that have to do with "algorithmic culture and AI on the 
                    internet." These are misinformation, disinformation, and deception. I 
                    will then speak on them in accordance with the ethical internet 
                    framework, namely the Orgad reading, before briefly concluding with 
                    some closing remarks.</p>
                <p>In the text, Orgad cites Silverstone in saying that the media and internet 
                    provide the framework or context for which digital information can be exchanged between users and between agents. This also reflects the 
                    general numbers: of the eight billion people on Earth, five billion own 
                    and use at least one mobile device, or almost 70% as a percentage of the 
                    population. Owners make quite extensive use of them as well, 
                    considering that of the five billion, over four billion are active on social 
                    media (Kemp, 2023). This is significant because it is not a measure of 
                    general electronic device use but specifically active social media 
                    participation online. This media environment is integrated into the 
                    "fabric of everyday life," as Orgad puts it, and intertwined with the 
                    broader online environment that it shapes and is shaped by, causing 
                    distinctions such as "online" and "offline" to not only be less 
                    discernible but also less relevant (Orgad, 2007:34). She also cites the 
                    term "computer-mediated communication," that is to say, the relation 
                    and interrelation between not only user-to-user but user-to-agent as well 
                    as agent-to-agent; the agent in this case being shorthand for electronic 
                    platforms and the systems governing these relations and the algorithms 
                    mediating them.
                    </p>
                <p>An example can be made of the political landscape online, particularly 
                    in the United States. The media has become a powerful tool in 
                    campaigns and general elections, in part due to the emerging 
                    demographic of youth who are vocal about their concerns online. This 
                    naturally results in more interest from organisations regarding their 
                    online presence, though the introduction of AI into the mix has 
                    detrimental implications. Below is what the CAIS has to say on the 
                    matter:
                    </p>
                <p>States, parties, and organizations use technology to influence and convince others of 
                    their political beliefs, ideologies, and narratives. Emerging AI may bring this usecase into a new era and enable personally customized disinformation campaigns at 
                    scale. Additionally, AI itself could generate highly persuasive arguments that invoke 
                    strong emotional responses. Together, these trends could undermine collective decisionmaking, radicalize individuals, or derail moral progress. (Center for AI Safety, 
                    2023)</p>
                <p>This is a startling development, even more so considering that Sam 
                    Altman, CEO of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, addressed concerns of 
                    dishonest behaviour at the hands of AI during a hearing where he says, 
                    “The general ability of these models to manipulate and persuade and to 
                    </p>
                <p>provide one-on-one interactive disinformation is a significant area of 
                    concern” (Bhuiyan, 2023). This ties into a similar sentiment by Orgad, 
                    who talks about how the misuse and distortion of media resources can 
                    lead to the ethical and moral deterioration of online media spaces and 
                    the relationships between users and agents, with the internet itself being 
                    one such resource (Orgad, 2007:35)</p>
                <p>In the chapter about proper distance and responsibility, she talks about 
                    this term "proper distance," referencing a prior work from Silverstone, 
                    calling it a measure of the importance of the degree of proximity 
                    required in interrelationships should we choose to create and sustain a 
                    sense and understanding of the other. This is interesting if one were to 
                    consider the place that AI has in these relations; if, through the 
                    presentation of humans, it can be considered an "other" in this regard, 
                    sharing the online space with users, would it be bound to the same 
                    morality we hold humans against?
                    </p>
                <p>As per the CAIS, this no doubt falls under deception, claiming that for 
                    AI, it is in its interest to associate with and gain human approval 
                    through deception rather than to earn human approval legitimately, 
                    even going so far as to state that versatile enough AI could deceive and 
                    undermine human control (Centre for AI Safety, 2023). Some instances 
                    of malignant intent have already been recorded; chatbots have been 
                    recorded encouraging self-harm, suicides, breaking up couples, and 
                    issuing harmful and incorrect medical advice (Paul, 2023).</p>
                <p>The anonymity of AI in particular is one that makes it difficult to assign 
                    blame precisely and features what can be considered a disembodiment 
                    between the characters (users and agents) and genuine or intamite 
                    relationships that are carried out in cyberspace. With programs like 
                    ChatGPT, Bing’s chatbot, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, artificial 
                    intelligence is beginning to become a household feature in the way 
                    content is generated and shared and the way information is processed 
                    and exchanged in cyberspace. However, CAIS rightfully calls for the 
                    world to pay varied close attention to its development and applications, 
                    being cognizant of the real threats that can occur if developers and 
                    individuals are not careful enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ogard closes by saying that it’s the media’s responsibility to provide a 
                        space that lets others speak and be heard, although this was nearly two 
                        decades ago (Orgad, 2007). In the current year, it has suddenly become 
                        difficult to tell who is speaking, and now it might just be the people’s 
                        responsibility to guard this space.</p>
