            <p class="blogtextsmall">This section talks about my motivations for designing the site in the manner I did, reflecting on how and why it is different from previous attempts, and how I feel this all translates to a better experience navigating the site.</p>

                        <!--<h3>First wireframe</h3>-->
                        <p> This was the orginal wireframe for out first assignment. It was relatively simple in hindsite, although helped in establishing concepts I'd later make use of in the final, revised site.</p>

                    <div class="layer">
                        <!--<h3>Second wireframe</h3>-->
                        <p>The second wireframe for our second assignment for the semester. This one was largely different than the first, forgoing the original concept and implementing a new design, afer the brief had expanded.</p>

                        <!--<h3>Third wireframe</h3>-->
                        <p> Now is the final wireframe for this exam and final assessment of the semester. It, ironically, more resembles the first one than the second design. I decided to attmept to repurpose the first design rather than building on the previous assignment's, as I felt it better for the site in hindsite.</p>

                        <p>The goal for the website wasto showcases a bit about myself as well as illustrate some of the techincal skills covered during the semester. The primary audience would the marker, and as such most of the content has to do with fulfilling the requirements set in the rubric. I aimed to create a visually appealing and creative experience by use of interesting colours and abstract patterns, juxatoposed against simple white backgrounds in some sections, as well as a generally adherence to standard visual desigin principles. </p>
                        <p>Most of the information has to do with adaqately conforming to what the brief expects from the site, and as sucg, I have layerd all five section on their own pages, in a way that they take up the entirety of each page, thus making it as easy as possible for the marker to get the complete scope of everything to be seen. The large gaps in between elements makes it easy to visually navigate from information to infromation, as each element takes up a discint space on the screen and does not compete with another leading to better visual clarity overall; this is accordance to the Fitts' Law,</p>

                    <section class="design-column-two">
                        <p>Due to the nature of site, flow from page to page is considerably easy and intuitive, as all one needs to do is scroll from the current point to the desired, though the option to simply use the navigation bar as an interaction point for traverseing the site, is another option available to users.</p>
                        <p> The first screen of course features the header and navbar, the latter having some slight animation when users hover over it; the underline acts as a point of interest, and serves to indidcate familirity to the users, the way hyperlinks are typically formatted. This is consistent across all instances of the site featuring links</p>
                        <P>A few of the other graphics in the other pages also feature slight animations or effects when the user interacts with them. This was done with the intent to mark relavent points of interest to the user across all portions of the sites.

                <h1>Style</h1>
                <section class="row">
                    <section class="design-column-two">
                        <p>As mentioned earlier in the site, the main reference for this final submission was actually the submission before this, which you can find <a href="https://2451668.github.io/2451668_Assignment_3/index.html">here</a></p>
                        <p>The visual design language of the site changed dramatically from that previous attempt, most notably the amount of graphics, effects, and of course content. </p>
                        <P>From this site, I mainted the same font Poppins sans-serif, one of four typefaces by Jonny Pinhorn. It ranks well in terms of both readability and legibility, though for more clarity and visual appeal I purposfully chose bolder or more weighted values for much of the text of the site. Given that the design of characters is fairly unifrom, increasing the weight would not lead to any strange overallping or visual incongrunces.</P>
                        <p>This site features much more colour than the previous attempts, enhancing the user experience by creating more visual interest. The flurry of colours are balanced by segments in pages that are completey monotone, epscially in regard to text, as not in impact how the user would consume information.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="design-column-one">
                        <p>Most of the site features large blocky containers that stand out from any background elements, some even featuring light animation effects. This makes it easier to layer content ontop of, with large spacing meaning that content would not compete with each other for the users attention.</p>
                        <p>While being square shaped still, I opted to feature significantly rounded corners, to complemet the general typeface of the website.</p>
                        <p>
                        The contrast of abstract backgrounds and plain containers I feel creates a good context onto which text and other information can be layered on top off, with some of the more important text and headers sharing colour codes with the supporting background elements and leading to a coherent visual sctructure overall
                        </p>

                    <section class="design-column-one">
                        <p>The goal was to create a pleasent looking website showcasing my liking for abstraction and art in a flat, simple approach.</p>
                        <p>As such, many portions of the site feature various pieces of abstract art that also servered as the guide for what sorts of colours would influnce the formatting of the text </p>
                        <p>This lead to some pretty interesting decisions as far as the user of colour goes. I also felt it important to have each page be different from the one preceeding it, as to avoid monotony and maintain visual interest at various parts of the site.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="design-column-two">
                        <p>For this reason, there are not particular standout colours apart from what happens to serve as the backdrop for whatever the contents of the page are, most being used as complemtery headers, whilst the bul of the title remains a light or dark hue</p>
                        <p>The font as stated earlier is the Poppins sans-serif font, with varying weights and no italics featured</p>
